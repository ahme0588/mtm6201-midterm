Animations:
1. All Headers in all 3 have a fade in from bottom animation including the background image. 
2. All download buttons have a hover animation that has a transition time of .5s. they change color and change back smoothly.
3. The two mobile image on the main page has a floating/bounce animation that lasts infinitely.
4. About page head has a fade in animation.
5. 3 sections have a fade in from the left animation. delay time is 0s.
6. 4 cards in the About section have the same fade in translate animation but since there is no javascript involved to enable the animation when it gets in the viewport. I have added a 2s delay to the card animation. each card has an additional .2s delay to make it seamless.
7. Contact page also has the same fade in header animation and for the sections as well.

Responsive Images:
1. All images have 2 images. one of them show with mobile styles and one of them shows with desktop.
2. The images added as background on the banners do not have responsive images since we have not doen responsive images as background images through css.
